1. Brighton Data Exploration
2. Modelling
3. Brighton (Complete) Include both data Exploration and Modelling in one file.

Assumptions:
The Wind turbine number

The first cell where all the files are joined to make complete data frame is comented out to run that code copy all the files from data folder and place in main folder. However after running the code the concatenated_data.scv file is genrated which is in root directory and that file be use further for analysis

Run the cell once by restarting the Kernal
